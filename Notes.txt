Without machine learning, there would be a lot of rules required to solve the problem.
Example, to differentiate between an apple and an orange, based on their texture and weight.
For doing this, we can train a classifier.

It is a function that takes data as input and gives labels as output.

Supervised learning:
providing training data along with labels to the algorithm to learn.
The algorithm analyzes the training data and produces a function that can now be applied to unlabelled examples.
  
there are many types of classifiers:
artifical neural network
support vector machine
lions
tigers
bears
oh my!

There are many data sets provided by the sklearn api itself.
yey :))
we are going to use the iris data set for this one.
